# 🟨  Longest Common Prefix?
Given an array of strings, the longest common prefix is the starting part that is common to all the strings.

### 🧠 Example:

```java
Input: ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
Output: "fl"
```
All strings start with "fl" — that’s the longest prefix they all share.

### ❌ Another Example:

```java
Input: ["dog", "racecar", "car"]
Output: ""
```

They don't share any starting letters.

So the common prefix is empty.
