- It is open-source and free
- It is secure, fast and powerful
- It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
- Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa


```java
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    	System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```


- Every line of code that runs in java must be inside a class.
- The main() method is like the entry point of the program execution.
- The main method is declared static because you need not create any objects to access or run the main method.
- The curly braces {} mark the beginning and ending of a code.
